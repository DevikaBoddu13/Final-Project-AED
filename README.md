# Infirmary Management System 
## Problem Statement:
The main issue with the existing system is that because all the systems are not connected, it will be challenging to process and handle requests when the system becomes overloaded. It is crucial to do tasks promptly and correctly in the modern day and in society. The request queue becomes more prominent due to this ineffective method of request resolution, making it hard to clear. The suggested approach ensures that each job has adequate access to the necessary actions to complete the work at hand correctly and precisely. This solution ensures that the User is constantly updated with the status of his record in the system.

## Proposed Solution:
Infirmary Management System is an organized application designed and programmed to deal with day-to-day operations and management of services that patients need access to in cases of emergency or injury. The program can manage inpatients, outpatients' records, data about lab tests, the status of the patient, and billings in the pharmacy. The project is about a hospital where patients can be registered through the reception login process and go through a doctor's consultation, take lab tests as prescribed by the doctor, request blood from blood banks, and take medicine from the dispensary as prescribed by the doctor. In cases of emergency, an ambulance can also register a patient from the accident location. Finally, the patient can view their bill and choose to pay themselves or through insurance, which requires verification from the insurance enterprise and a related verification from a police officer from the police enterprise. Finally, the patient can be discharged after receiving approval from outpatient administration.
